# Jotai Playground

## About
This little project is all about taking `Demo 1` from [Jotai introducion](https://jotai.org/docs/introduction)
and do some code splitting.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Structure
I have created 3 different components:
* `components/CharCount.js`
* `components/Input.js`
* `components/Uppercase.js`

And a dedicated file for the state's atoms, `state/Atoms.js`

## Run locally
In the project directory, you can run locally the app in development mode:

```
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
